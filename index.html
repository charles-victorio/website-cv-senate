          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Charles Victorio and I'm a first year Computer
            Science major at IVC. If I'm not at school or work, I'm probably
            programming, working out, learning about politics, biking, or
            watching The Sopranos. I'm running for Senate because there are a
            lot of small, incremental changes we could make to this school to
            make it a lot better. Vote for me. 😎🤙

          <h5>**Mental Health** ❤️</h5>
          <p>
            Give more resources to the Health and Wellness Center and increase
            the amount of free <b>therapy</b> sessions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue">
          <h5>**Bicycling Infrastructure** 🚴</h5>
          <p>Build more wave-style <b>bike racks</b> around campus.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue">
          <h5>**Energy** ☀️</h5>
          <p>
            Put more <b>solar panels</b> on rooftops. This will pay for itself over
            time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue">
          <h5>**Public Transportation** 🚌</h5>
          <p>
            Expand the <b>Free OC Bus Pass</b> to teachers and staff. Also, make it
            so that you have to opt in to get it, so the school doesn't spend
            money for people who don't use it. That way, you increase access
            while reducing costs at the same time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue">
          <h5>**Water Use** 🌵</h5>
          <p>
            Instead of grass, start growing more biodiverse, native plants that
            don't need as much water.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="issue">
          <h5>**Out-of-State and International Students** 🌎</h5>
          <p>
            Advocate for the state government to broaden eligibility for the
            <b>Promise Program</b>. Out-of-state and international students are
            excluded from free tuition and other benefits, even though they put
            in equal work and face equal (or greater) hardships as California
            residents do.

          <h5>**Cybersecurity and Freedom of Expression** ✊</h5>
          <p>
            Run a <b>Tor exit node</b>. Journalists and whistleblowers in
            authoritarian countries rely on The Tor Project to securely
            communicate without surveillance. Ordinary people don't have the
            resources to set up an exit node — but IVC does. IVC should support
            freedom of expression and the right to privacy by helping to
            maintain Tor. Together, we can let IVC join the ranks of the 
            <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-launches-tor-university-challenge">
            many universities around the world</a> that already do this.

          <h5>**Pedestrian Infrastructure** 🚶</h5>
          <p>
            Work with the City of Irvine and Manassero Farms to put a
            <b>sidewalk</b> on Jeffrey.
