          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Charles Victorio and I'm a first year Computer
            Science major at IVC. If I'm not at school or work, I'm probably
            programming, working out, learning about politics, biking, or
            watching The Sopranos. I'm running for Senate because there are a
            lot of small, incremental changes we could make to this school to
            make it a lot better. Vote for me. 😎 🤙

          <p>
            Put more <b>solar panels</b> on rooftops. This will pay for itself

          <h5>🚌 Public Transportation</h5>
          <p>
            Expand the <b>Free OC Bus Pass</b> to teachers and staff. Also, make
            it so that you have to opt in to get it, so the school doesn't spend
            money for people who don't use it. That way, you increase access
            while reducing costs at the same time.

            Instead of grass, start growing more biodiverse, native plants that
            don't need as much water.

            Advocate for the state government to broaden eligibility for the
