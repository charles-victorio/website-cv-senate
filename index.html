          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Charles Victorio and I'm a first year Computer
            Science major at IVC. If I'm not at school or work, I'm probably
            programming, working out, learning about politics, biking, or
            watching The Sopranos. I'm running for Senate because there are a
            lot of small, incremental changes we could make to this school to
            make it a lot better. Vote for me. 😎 🤙

              Expand the <b>Free OC Bus Pass</b> to teachers and staff. Also,
              make it so that you have to opt in to get it, so the school
              doesn't spend money for people who don't use it. That way, you
              increase access while reducing costs at the same time.
